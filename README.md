# OptimNow FinOps Assistant (MCP + Bedrock + Chainlit)

This project is a **FinOps assistant** built on top of **AWS Bedrock**, **LangChain**, and the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.  
It connects to external MCP servers (such as **AWS Billing & Cost Management**, Azure, and GCP) to query cloud costs and enrich the assistant with live data and tools.  

The UI is powered by **Chainlit**, giving you a chat interface where you can:
- Analyze AWS costs and usage through the AWS Billing MCP server  
- Generate charts and graphs from cost data (Vega-Lite renderer)  
- Create diagrams or images (Mermaid + Amazon Titan Image Generator v2)  
- Extend the assistant with moreMCP servers (Azure, GCP, etc.)  

---

## âœ… What weâ€™ve done so far

- Set up a self-contained **EC2 instance** with Python virtual environment.  
- Installed and pinned correct versions of Chainlit, LangChain, MCP, and adapters.  
- Added `.chainlit/mcp.json` to declare external MCP servers (e.g. AWS Billing).   
- Added `.env` loader for credentials (AWS_REGION, AWS_PROFILE, etc.).  
- Debugged compatibility issues between Chainlit and MCP, with logging enabled.

## ðŸ“– Tutorial / Installation

### Prerequisites

The Chainlit configuration expects an `uvx` executable to be available in your `PATH` so it can launch the AWS Billing MCP server defined in `.chainlit/mcp.json`. Install the [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package (which provides the `uvx` shim) following the upstream instructions for your platform, or provide an equivalent wrapper script checked into this repository and ensure it is executable and discoverable via `PATH`.

Follow the step-by-step tutorial provided in the [`docs/INSTALL.md`](docs/INSTALL.md) file.
It explains how to:

1. Prepare the Python environment  
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`  
3. Configure `.env` with your AWS credentials and region  
4. Run the AWS Billing MCP server  
5. Start Chainlit and connect to the assistant

## ðŸš€ Usage

From your EC2 instance:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG CHAINLIT_MCP_CONFIG=.chainlit/mcp.json \
chainlit run src/ui/app.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Then open the app in your browser at:

http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:8000

## ðŸ”§ Next steps

Add Azure MCP and GCP MCP servers to `.chainlit/mcp.json`.


## Technical Implementation

### LangGraph Integration

This project uses LangGraph to create a ReAct agent that follows this workflow:

1. The agent receives user input via the Chainlit interface
2. It analyzes the input to determine if mathematical operations are needed
3. When cloud billing data is required, it uses the MCP tools to perform calculations
4. Results are returned to the user with a detailed explanation

The ReAct agent is created using `langgraph.prebuilt.create_react_agent()`, which orchestrates the reasoning and tool-use process.

### LangChain MCP Adapters

The `langchain-mcp-adapters` package serves as a bridge between LangChain and MCP:

- `load_mcp_tools()` converts MCP tools into LangChain-compatible tools
- These tools are then provided to the LangGraph agent for use in the ReAct loop
- This enables seamless integration between the Claude model on Amazon Bedrock and the custom math tools

This adapter pattern allows the application to easily incorporate additional MCP servers with different capabilities in the future.


## Development

The project structure includes:

- `src/ui/app.py`: The Chainlit application setup with LangGraph and MCP integration
- `src/utils/`: Utility modules for Bedrock integration and streaming

To modify the MCP server or add new capabilities, edit the `src/mcp/server.py` file and rebuild using `uv build`.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues connecting to Bedrock, check your AWS credentials and ensure you have the necessary permissions.
- For MCP connection issues, verify that the wheel file exists in the dist directory and that you're using the correct command in the Chainlit interface.
- Check the logs in the terminal running the Chainlit application for detailed error messages. You can set the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `DEBUG` to get more detailed logs.
